My name is Lucas Hernandez. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache (sometimes)
- I am studying the data science track at the Lambda School
- I have a passion for computers, coding, and technology in general
- Am extremely invested in any project I take on
- I sometimes oversell how great my mustache is...*sometimes*

### My story

I am currently a Systems Analyst for a Charter School in Bronx, NY. As a NYC native and lifelong resident, I began my career as a Teaching Assistant for 8th Grade Science. I often volunteered my time after school to help run a Science Olympiad program, and when I wasn't helping with Science Olympiad, I taught middle school kids programming with the use of Arduino projects. My interest in technology allowed me to change positions to a Systems Analyst at the same school, where I would further hone my technical knowledge of the data science field. Soon afterwards, I discovered a coding boot camp by the name of the Lambda School, where I am currently enrolled as a student and am continuing to develop my skills.
