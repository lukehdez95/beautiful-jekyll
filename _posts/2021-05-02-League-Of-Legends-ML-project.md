[What is League of Legends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtROJeMPeE)
League of Legends is an online game known as a MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. A team of 5 players takes on another team of 5 players, in order to capture various objectives around the map known as Summoner's Rift. The ultimate objective? To destroy the opposing team's nexus before they destroy yours.

As of today, League of Legends continues to be the biggest e-sport in the world. In 2018, the [League of Legends World Championship brought in viewers rivalling that of the NFL SuperBowl](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-vs-superbowl-viewer-numbers). 

I have played League of Legends for a couple of years now, and have somewhat of a love-hate relationship with the game. Why? Simply because I hate losing. What better way to improve my winrate than to look at the [data from over 50,000 ranked games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/league-of-legends) and use my Data Science knowledge to see if I could analyze what exactly are the things that leads to victory in a League of Legends game.

After reading in my data, I ran it through pandas profile inspector view some surface level data analysis with the data. {% include PandasProfiling.html %}
